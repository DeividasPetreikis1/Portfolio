- This is my project done on the data that I have gathered form Wikipedia on the top UK companies. 

- This data was gathered using web scraping to collect and create a new dataset. 

- When working with this dataset I had created a dashboard and presentation of my findings. 

- I was conducting research into finding more information about the top companies and to see 
if there is a correlation between how many employees a company has compared to how much profit has  
been made. 

- This was done as I hoped to find out more information about what is happening with the jobs market  
due to a lot of companies firing their employes in order to uphold their profits, making job finding a  
lot harder.
